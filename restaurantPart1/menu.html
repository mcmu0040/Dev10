						<td><center>Only the best for you. This hotdish is lovingly made by a real grandma while you talk to her about what your are doing now and why you don't visit anymore. With fresh tater tots, cheddar cheese and homemade cream of mushroom soup, there is nothing better to brigthen your day.
						<br />$19.99</center></td>
						<td><center>Well, grandpa, he sure does try hard. Not nearly as good as grandma's, but it comes with less guilt but you have to make a promise to come back this weekend and mow the yard. It'll stick to your bones and warm you right up.
						<br />$15.99</center></td>
						<td><center>Look, mom is busy. This is just grandma's hotdish leftover from when you ate there last weekend. You have to pop it in the microwave yourself, because between soccer practice, hockey practice, dance lessons, music lessons, and with your father out-of-town, you can do something for yourself.
						<br />$9.99</center>

					<tr><!--Item Description-->
						<td><center>If you thought was only for breakfast, well, you're only half right. Our selection of gourmet SPAM will always hit the spot. Choose between teriyaki or honey glazed. Nothing quite hits the spot like SPAM.
						<br />$9.99</center></td>
						<td><center>This classic is made every Thanksgiving when my family gets together and has a little too much eggnog. It's been frozen since then, but we've been letting it warm up all day so it should be good. Comes buttered with your choice of fillings.
						<br />Sugar $4.49
						<br />Brown Sugar $4.99</center></td>
						<td><center>Seriously? You like this stuff? Alright, but if you are eating on a dare or because it was written in your mother inlaw's will, pleas eat it away from the truck. No really, no one else wants to smell that.
